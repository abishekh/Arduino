notes on the Dangerpants Labs Air Data Instrument

these notes briefly describe some of the information you need to put
together an ADI.  where information is missing (ie, full hookup of the
LCD), that information is widel available online.

digital pins:

arduino: function
2: SET button
4: + button
5: - button
6: backlight pwm (future)
7: LCD RS
8: LCD EN
9: LCD DB4
10: LCD DB5
11: LCD DB6
12: LCD DB7

analog pins:

A0: differential pressure in
A4: I2C SDA (BMP085 and DS1307 clock)
A5: I2C SCL (BMP085 and DS1307 clock)

LCD pins:

1: ground
2: +5v
3: contrast pot wiper
4: RS arduino pin 7
5: ground
6: EN arduino pin 8

11: DB4 arduino pin 9
12: DB5 arduino pin 10
13: DB6 arduino pin 11
14: DB7 arduino pin 12
15: arduino pin 6 (backlight)
16: ground

AREF set to 2.5v with 2x 500 ohm resistor voltage splitter

NOTE: Barometric pressure sensor must have 3.6V max supply voltage, do
not feed with 5V!

SET, + and - buttons are pulled high by the arduino's internal 10k
resistors, then ground when closed

LCD contrast is set with 10k trimmer pot as voltage divider, wiper to
LCD pin 3

parts list:

* Arduino Uno (or similar, with ATMEGA328 processor)
* Sparkfun BMP085 barometric pressure sensor breakout
* DIYDrones MPXV5004DP differential pressure sensor breakout
* DS1307 clock module (various sources)
* 16x2 character LCD
* 3x momentary, NO pushbuttons
* 10k potentiometer
* 2x 500 ohm resistors

when installed, the ADI will be powered via a vehicle 12V system,
probably through a 7805 voltage regulator.  it could also be operated
from 3xAA batteries.  at one point (before the clock module was added)
current draw was around 150 mA at full backlight, so a set of NiMH AAs
should last about 10 hours in the real world.
